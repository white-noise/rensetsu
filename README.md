## rensetsu 連接 (a kanji collection app)

### things to do
- goal is quick, easily navigable, intuitive connections. collection of information rather than a game, competition, or motivational fervor. it should remind you of what you need to learn, but beautifully, and calmly.
- individual accounts should hold reference to interesting, difficult, and mastered kanji, along with other personal data not yet determined.
- user should be able to comment for a given kanji, i.e. store plain text notes about its use, as well as example sentences, in clean, minimal boxes directly accessible with the kanji.
- simple themes, almost entirely text based. lightweight is emphasis. light and dark mode.
- on the backend, post-saves should be handled outside of the model file before deployment.

### what is displayed on a profile
- standard user data: name, username, password, email.
- kanji found intersting (either memorable, strange, useful)
- kanji found particularly difficult and particularly easy
- possible ability to create custom groups (with ability to override the above on one's home page)
- link to review, scroll through these groups
- something to identify a user (eventually people should be able to see other profiles). the goal is placid communication, not competition
