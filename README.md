## rensetsu 連接　(a kanji collection app)

### things to do
- goal is quick, easily navigable, intuitive connections. collection of information rather than a game, competition, or motivational fervor. it should remind you of what you need to learn, but beautifully, and calmly.
- individual accounts should hold reference to interesting, difficult, and mastered kanji, along with other personal data not yet determined.
- user should be able to comment for a given kanji, i.e. store plain text notes about its use, as well as example sentences, in clean, minimal boxes directly accessible with the kanji.
- simple themes, almost entirely text based. lightweight is emphasis. light and dark mode.
- on the backend, post-saves should be handled outside of the model file before deployment.
- login and logout pages still need to be written, as well as schema for what non-users should see (some sort of lightweight exploration mode).
